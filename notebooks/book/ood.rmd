# Launching RStudio on Singularity with OOD

1. Go to [ood.ccv.brown.edu](ood.ccv.brown.edu) and log in with your credentials.
2. On the landing page select the **RStudio on Singularity** app. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('images/ood_apps_rstudio-sing_highlight.png'))
```

3. Fill in the following fields and leave the other fields empty
   - Number of Hours: 48
   - Num Cores: 4
   - Memory: 16
   - Singularity Container Path: `/gpfs/data/shared/databases/workshops/reproducibility_r/reproducibility_r.sif`
   - Path for R Executable: `~/bin/R`
  
It should look like the two images below.
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('images/rstudio_singularity_1.png'))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('images/rstudio_singularity_2.png'))
```

If it seems like it is taking too long, you can change `Number of Hours` to `1` for the purposes of following along with this workshop.      

4. Select Launch. The session will now be queued. You will be brought to your interactive sessions dashboard. 

5. When the session is ready a **Connect to RStudio Server** button will appear (see image below). Click this button to launch your instance.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('images/my_interactive_session.png'))
```
