# R (programming langauge)

## Introductio

'''R''' is a [[programming language]] for [[statistical computing]] and graphics supported by the R Core Team and the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. Created by statisticians [[Ross Ihaka]] and [[Robert Gentleman (statistician)\|Robert Gentleman]], R is used among [[Data mining\|data miners]], [[Bioinformatics\|bioinformaticians]] and [[statistician]]s for [[data analysis]] and developing [[statistical software]]. The core R language is augmented by a large number of [[R package\|extension packages]] containing reusable code and documentation.

According to user surveys and studies of scholarly literature databases, R is one of the most commonly used programming languages in data mining.

The official R software environment is an open-source [[free software]] environment released as part of the [[GNU Project]] and available under the [[GNU General Public License]]. It is written primarily in [[C (programming language)\|C]], [[Fortran]], and R itself (partially [[Self-hosting (compilers)\|self-hosting]]). Precompiled [[executable]]s are provided for various [[operating system]]s. R has a [[command line interface]].

Multiple third-party [[graphical user interface]]s are also available, such as [[RStudio]], an [[integrated development environment]], and [[Jupyter]], a [[notebook interface]].

History

R was started by professors [[Ross Ihaka]] and [[Robert Gentleman (statistician)\|Robert Gentleman]] as a programming language to teach introductory statistics at the [[University of Auckland]]. The language took heavy inspiration from the [[S (programming language)\|S programming language]] with most S programs able to run unaltered in R as well as from [[Scheme (programming language)\|Scheme's]] [[lexical scoping]] allowing for local variables. The name of the language comes from being an S language successor and the shared first letter of the authors, Ross and Robert. Ihaka and Gentleman first shared [[Binary file\|binaries]] of R on the data archive StatLib and the ''s-news'' mailing list in August 1993. In June 1995, statistician Martin MÃ¤chler convinced Ihaka and Gentleman to make R [[Free and open-source software\|free and open-source]] under the [[GNU General Public License]]. R officially became a GNU project on 5 December 1997 when version 0.60 released. The first official 1.0 version was released on 29 February 2000.
